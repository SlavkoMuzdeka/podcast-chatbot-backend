## üöÄ Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SlavkoMuzdeka/podcast-chatbot-backend.git
cd podcast-chatbot-backend
```

### 2. Set Up Python Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment activated, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory.

### 5. Database Setup

1. Create a new PostgreSQL database:
   ```bash
   createdb podcast_chatbot
   ```

2. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

### 6. Start the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

### 7. Verify Installation

To verify everything is working correctly, you can call the health check endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

You should receive a response like:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-16T09:50:16.123456"
}
```

## üîß Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Virtual Environment Not Activating
If you're having trouble activating the virtual environment:
- On Windows, try: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
- Ensure you're in the project root directory
- If using PowerShell, you might need to change the execution policy: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

### Missing Dependencies
If you get import errors, ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check your `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file
- Ensure the database user has the correct permissions

### Environment Variables Not Loading
- Ensure the `.env` file is in the root directory
- The file should be named exactly `.env` (not `.env.txt` or similar)
- Restart your terminal/IDE after creating the `.env` file
